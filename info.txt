
 Simulation to discover how auction features affect price and promote different strategic behaviours.   
 The companion paper _No title_ explains the rules and provides justification for the variables  
 and their vaules and value ranges. 

#### The simulation

 Sequence is as follows:
 1. populate the auction house with many auctions (games) and give each player a random valuation  
    according to certain probability density functions
 2. initialise first round, then repeat steps 3-5
 3. remove those not within own valuation 
 4. select from attentive players
 5. place bid

 At game over, the highest bidders win.
