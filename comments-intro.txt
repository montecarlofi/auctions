This simulation is not generic; its premise is an imagined used car auction house with bids being made online. The cars can be inspected and test driven in person. Similar cars are also readily available in other second-hand markets. The reason we consider the specific case of used cars is that not every auction type is the same. Real estate is more open-ended, art is even more so, but it is unlikely someone would be overprice for an item they could easily acquire on a different marketplace and of which there are many of a similar kind. Thus there is a natural upper bound for the value agents would place in any given item. Naturally, states auctioning off bands of the electromagnetic spectrum or auction houses putting up ultra rare objects such as famous people's watches and cars are completely different in their bidding and pricing dynamics. The same is true for cheap-item auctions where one can test out different strategies at little cost. Each auction type, with its particular characteristics, requires a different model. The present model, while adaptable to many types, recreates the main dynamics of used-car auctions. 

The components acting out their effects on each other (and the final price) are the discussed under. But first: The beta function, a key feature, determines how the probabilities for valuations and populations are distributed. Its shape, such as concentration, tail, symmetry, and mean, can all be manipulated to fit different purposes. The beta function is defined as:
